SELECTIONS

Selections let you work with multiple circuits simultaneously. You can select 
circuits by rubberband selection or by toggling their selection state with control
+ left click. Every selected circuit will move as a group as long as they are 
selected. You can also decide to save these selected circuits for later use. For 
example to insert them to a different setup. Or alternatively you can delete all 
the selected circuits.
